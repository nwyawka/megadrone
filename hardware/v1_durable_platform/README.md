# V1 - Durable Construction Platform

**Type:** Fixed-Wing | **Config:** Conventional Pusher | **Status:** Development

## Quick Specs

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Wingspan | 1.0-1.2m |
| Length | 0.6m |
| AUW | 800-1000g |
| Payload | 300g |
| Endurance | 25-30 min |
| Cruise Speed | 54 km/h (15 m/s) |
| Flight Controller | Pixhack / SpeedyBee F405 |
| Propulsion | 1x Electric (2212 920kv) |

## Purpose

- Transition to permanent construction techniques
- Test camera and gimbal configurations
- Refine autopilot tuning
- Develop repeatable build processes

## Configuration

Same as V0: conventional pusher fixed-wing with upgraded construction.

## Construction Upgrade from V0

| V0 Material | V1 Upgrade | Benefit |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Foam board | Depron/EPP + carbon spar | Durability, stiffness |
| Packing tape | Heat shrink film (Oracover) | Cleaner surface, lighter |
| Hot glue | Epoxy + foam-safe CA | Stronger joints |
| Bamboo skewers | Carbon fiber tubes/rods | Strength-to-weight |

## Camera Test Configurations

| Config | Camera | Gimbal | Weight | Purpose |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| A | GoPro (bare) | Fixed mount | 120g | Baseline video |
| B | RunCam 5 Orange | Fixed mount | 60g | Lighter option |
| C | Caddx Peanut | 2-axis micro gimbal | 100g | Stabilized FPV |
| D | Sony RX0 II | 2-axis brushless | 200g | High-quality stills |

## Gimbal Options

| Gimbal | Axes | Payload | Weight | Cost |
|--------|------|---------|--------|------|
| FeiyuTech Mini 3D | 3 | 200g | 85g | $80 |
| Tarot T-2D | 2 | 200g | 110g | $60 |
| Custom micro (3D printed) | 2 | 100g | 50g | $30 |

## Additional Budget (over V0)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Depron/EPP sheets | $30 |
| Carbon tubes/rods | $25 |
| Heat shrink covering | $20 |
| Test cameras (2-3) | $150-300 |
| Micro gimbal | $60-80 |
| **Total Additional** | **~$350** |

## Skills Developed

- Composite basics
- Camera integration
- PID tuning
- Repeatable build processes

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Overweight | Careful weight tracking |
| CG issues | Calculate before flight |
