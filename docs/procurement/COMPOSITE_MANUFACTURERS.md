## Procurement Notes

### Request for Quote (RFQ) Information

When requesting quotes, provide:

1. **Part Drawings** - CAD files (STEP, IGES) or dimensioned drawings
2. **Material Specification** - Fiber type, weave, core material
3. **Quantity** - Prototype, low volume, or production
4. **Quality Requirements** - Tolerances, surface finish, certifications
5. **Timeline** - Delivery requirements
6. **Application** - UAV type, flight conditions

### Typical Lead Times

| Order Type | Lead Time |
|------------|-----------|
| Stock parts | 1-5 days |
| CNC cut from stock | 1-2 weeks |

| Tooling fabrication | 4-12 weeks |

### Cost Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Tooling (molds, fixtures) | High upfront, amortized over volume |
| Material grade | Aerospace prepreg > wet layup |
| Complexity | More curves/features = higher cost |
| Tolerances | Tighter = higher cost |
| Volume | Higher volume = lower per-unit cost |
| Location | US/EU > Asia (but shipping, tariffs) |

### Quality Considerations

| Certification | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| ISO 9001 | Quality management system |
| AS9100 | Aerospace quality standard |
| NADCAP | Special process accreditation |
