## 1. Executive Summary

**JP Security** is a private maritime security company pursuing authorization to conduct direct interdiction operations against drug trafficking and human smuggling vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.

### Strategic Vision

**Primary Objective:** Obtain a **Letter of Marque and Reprisal** from Congress authorizing private interdiction operations against narco-traffickers and hostile non-state actors.

**Secondary Objective:** Secure government contracts for ISR and maritime domain awareness services to federal agencies (USCG, CBP, DOD).

---

## 3. Strategic Intent

### 3.1 Letter of Marque - Primary Objective

JP Security was formed with the primary intent of obtaining a **Letter of Marque and Reprisal** from Congress.

**Constitutional Basis:** Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 grants Congress the power to issue Letters of Marque authorizing private vessels to capture enemy ships and cargo.

**Modern Application:** While not issued since 1815, the constitutional authority remains. The rise of narco-trafficking, human smuggling, and maritime terrorism presents a compelling case for reviving this tool.

### 3.2 Why Letter of Marque?

| Challenge | Government Response | LOM Solution |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| Vast maritime domain | Limited patrol assets | Private sector augmentation |
| Resource constraints | Budget limitations | Incentive-based model |
| Taxpayer burden | Direct appropriations | Prize money from seizures |
| Reactive posture | Respond to tips | Persistent private patrols |
| Geographic coverage | Prioritize high-risk areas | Fill coverage gaps |

### 3.3 LOM Pursuit Strategy

**Congressional Engagement:**
- Brown has contact in Congress - key relationship for LOM pursuit
- Build bipartisan support for modern privateering concept
- Develop legislative framework proposal
- Demonstrate operational capability and track record

**Phased Approach:**
```
2026: BUILD CAPABILITY
├── Develop platforms (VA-, VS-, VSS-)
├── Build team and procedures
├── Initial operations (Key West)
└── Establish federal relationships

2027: DEMONSTRATE EFFECTIVENESS
├── Government contracts (ISR, MDA)
├── Track record of successful support
├── Congressional briefings
└── Develop VA-5S armed capability

2028+: PURSUE LETTER OF MARQUE
├── Congressional sponsor engagement
├── Legal framework proposal
├── LOM application
└── Authorization
```

### 3.4 Government Contracting - Secondary Objective

While pursuing the Letter of Marque, JP Security will generate revenue through government contracts:

**Target Agencies:**
- U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)
- Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
- Department of Defense (DOD)
- Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
- Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

**Contract Vehicles:**
- GSA Schedule (future)
- Small Business Set-Asides
- Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs)
- Direct contracts

## 4. Market Analysis

### 4.1 Market Opportunity

**Drug Trafficking Volume:**
- Estimated $50+ billion annual drug flow through Gulf/Caribbean
- USCG intercepts represent small fraction of total flow
- Vast ungoverned maritime space

**Government Spending:**
- USCG budget: ~$13 billion annually
- CBP Air and Marine: ~$1.8 billion annually
- DOD counter-narcotics: ~$1.2 billion annually

**Market Gap:**
- Insufficient patrol assets for maritime domain
- High cost of government operations
- Need for persistent surveillance capability

### 4.2 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Government agencies** | Authority, resources | Limited assets, high cost |
| **Defense contractors** | Scale, relationships | High overhead, slow |
| **Small UAS companies** | Agile, low cost | Limited maritime capability |
| **Private security** | Established | No offensive capability |

### 4.3 Target Customers

**Pre-LOM:**
- USCG Sector Key West
- CBP Air and Marine Operations
- JIATF-South
- State/local law enforcement

**Post-LOM:**
- Self-funded operations with prize money
