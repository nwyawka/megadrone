## 1. Executive Summary

JP Security is formed with the primary intent of obtaining a **Letter of Marque and Reprisal** from the United States Congress, authorizing private maritime interdiction operations against vessels engaged in drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other hostile activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.

**Strategic Vision:** Become a congressionally authorized privateer conducting direct interdiction operations against narco-traffickers and hostile non-state actors threatening U.S. maritime security.

**Core Capability:** Multi-domain unmanned systems (aerial, surface, subsurface) for persistent surveillance, vessel identification, threat assessment, and—upon LOM authorization—direct interdiction and seizure.

**Phased Approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (Current):** Build operational capability, demonstrate effectiveness supporting federal agencies
2. **Phase 2 (Near-term):** Pursue government contracts for ISR and maritime domain awareness
3. **Phase 3 (Primary Goal):** Obtain Letter of Marque for authorized private interdiction operations

**Operational Model:** Self-funded operations with compensation tied to successful interdiction. Upon LOM issuance, prize money from seized vessels and cargo per congressional authorization.

---

## 2. Strategic Intent: Letter of Marque

### 2.1 Constitutional Basis

The U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 grants Congress the power:

> *"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water"*

Letters of Marque have not been issued since the War of 1812, but the constitutional authority remains intact. The rise of narco-trafficking, human smuggling, and maritime terrorism presents a modern case for reviving this tool.

### 2.2 Modern Application

**Target Actors:**
- Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) operating vessels in Gulf of Mexico / Caribbean
- Human smuggling networks
- Hostile non-state actors threatening U.S. maritime interests

**Rationale for LOM:**
- Federal agencies (USCG, CBP) are resource-constrained
- Vast maritime domain exceeds government patrol capacity
- Private sector can augment national maritime security
- Incentive-based model (prize money) reduces taxpayer burden
- Historical precedent for privateering in national defense

```

### 6.2 Phase 1: Detection

**Objective:** Identify vessels of interest within the AO

**Methods:**
- VS-1 picket vessel AIS monitoring (passive)
- VS-1 radar surveillance (active)
- VSS-1S acoustic monitoring (passive)
- VA-2/VA-4 long-range aerial patrol
- Shore-based monitoring (Starlink data feed)

**Triggers for Phase 2:**
- Vessel without AIS in monitored area
- Vessel exhibiting suspicious behavior
- Acoustic signature matching threat profile
- Intelligence tip or tasking from authorities

**Output:** Initial detection report with position, course, speed, preliminary assessment

### 6.3 Phase 2: Identification

**Objective:** Positively identify vessel and assess threat level

**Methods:**
- VA-1/VA-2 medium-range ISR overflight
- VA-5R close-range inspection (500m-2km standoff)
- Visual identification (hull number, flag, name)
- Thermal/IR imaging for personnel count
- Photographic documentation

**Information Required:**
| Data Point | Source | Priority |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Vessel name | Visual/camera | High |
| Hull number | Visual/camera | High |
| Flag state | Visual/camera | High |
| Vessel type | Visual/camera | High |
| Personnel count | Thermal/visual | Medium |
| Cargo visible | Visual/camera | Medium |
| Vessel condition | Visual | Low |

**Output:** Vessel identification report with imagery, assessment of threat level

### 6.4 Phase 3: Track

**Objective:** Maintain continuous custody of vessel of interest

**Methods:**
- VA-2/VA-4 persistent overhead coverage
- VS-1 surface tracking (radar, visual)
- Handoff coordination between platforms
- Position reporting to authorities

**Track Custody Requirements:**
- Position update minimum every 15 minutes
- Predicted course and speed
- Estimated time to key waypoints (territorial waters, ports)

**Output:** Continuous track data feed to authorities and operations center

### 6.5 Phase 4: Interdiction

**Objective:** Support authority boarding operation

**Note:** JP Security does not conduct interdiction. Federal authorities (USCG, CBP) execute all interdiction operations.

**JP Security Role:**
- Provide real-time vessel position to boarding team
- Conduct final pre-boarding threat assessment (VA-5R)
- Provide overwatch during approach
- Document interdiction for evidence/records

**Coordination:**
- Handoff to USCG/CBP at designated point
- Maintain comms with boarding team
- Provide requested intelligence support

### 6.6 Phase 5: Boarding Support

**Objective:** Provide intelligence support during boarding operation

**Methods:**
- VA-5R overhead for situational awareness
- Real-time video feed to command element (if requested)
- Personnel tracking on vessel
- Early warning of other vessel approach

**Post-Boarding:**
- Document seized vessel/cargo
- Provide imagery for evidence package
- Debrief with authorities
- Update intelligence databases
